Your voice echoes in the darkness.
You listen, but there is no reply.
Your words are swallowed by the void.
The darkness refuses to respond.
No one answers. 
You feel utterly and totally alone.
Your voice bounces off the walls and fades into the darkness.
You are surprised at how quiet your voice sounds.
You feel a little awkward about breaking the silence.
